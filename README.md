# Supply Chain Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze supply chain data and visualize various aspects such as revenue, sales, shipping costs, and defect rates.

## Project Structure


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/supply_chain_analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd supply_chain_analysis
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas plotly matplotlib numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your `supply_chain_data.csv` file in the `data` directory.
2. Run any of the analysis scripts:
    ```sh
    python src/price_vs_revenue.py
    python src/revenue_by_products.py
    python src/sales_by_product_type.py
    python src/total_revenue_by_shipping_carriers.py
    python src/revenue_by_sku.py
    python src/shipping_cost_of_carriers.py
    python src/cost_distribution_by_transportation_mode.py
    python src/defect_rate_by_product.py
    ```

Each script will generate a specific plot or visualization as described in the code.

## Visualizations

1. **Price vs Revenue generated**
2. **Revenue Generated by the products**
3. **Sales by Product Type**
4. **Total revenue generated from shipping carriers**
5. **Revenue generated by each SKU**
6. **Shipping cost of carriers**
7. **Cost distribution by transportation mode**
8. **Defect rate of product while shipping**

Each visualization helps to understand different aspects of the supply chain data.
